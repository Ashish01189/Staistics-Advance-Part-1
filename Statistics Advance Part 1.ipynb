How do cumulative distribution function (CDF) differ from probability distribution function (PDF)?\n    # The PDF, used for continuous random variables, tells you how densely the probability is packed around each value. It doesn't give you the probability that a variable equals an exact value (because that’s always zero for continuous variables), but it tells you how likely the variable is to fall near that value.\n    # For example, the normal distribution’s PDF (the bell curve) peaks at the mean. That means values near the mean are more likely than values far away.\n    # In the discrete case, this role is played by the PMF (Probability Mass Function), which tells you the actual probability at each point. For example, in a die roll, the PMF says the probability of getting a 3 is 1/6.\n\n    # The CDF gives the cumulative probability up to a certain point. In other words, it tells you the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a given value.\n    # It starts at 0 (as nothing is less than negative infinity), and as you move to the right along the number line, it steadily increases, eventually reaching 1 (because the total probability is 1).\n    # For example, in the standard normal distribution:\n        # The CDF value at 0 is 0.5 — meaning there’s a 50% chance the value is less than or equal to 0.\n        # As you go further right (say to 2), the CDF might be 0.977, meaning there's a 97.7% chance the value is less than or equal to 2.\n\n# The Core Difference\n    # The PDF/PMF shows the instantaneous likelihood (either density or mass), while the CDF shows the accumulated probability up to a point.\n    # Think of the PDF like the speed of a car at any moment — how fast it’s going right now — and the CDF like the distance traveled — how much ground has been covered up to that point.\n\n# Their Relationship (for continuous variables)\n    # If you have the PDF, you can get the CDF by integrating it. That means you’re adding up the probability density from the far left up to the value you care about.\n    # Conversely, if you have the CDF, you can get the PDF by differentiating it — the PDF is the slope of the CDF curve.",

What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n    # The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the most important results in statistics because it provides the foundation for making inferences about population parameters from sample statistics.\n    # When you take sufficiently large random samples from any population (with a finite mean and variance), the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.\n\n# Key Components:\n    # 1. Random sampling: The samples must be independent and randomly selected.\n    # 2. Sample size: Larger sample sizes (usually n≥30) make the approximation better.\n    # 3. Finite variance: The population must have a finite mean (μ) and variance (σ²).\n    # 4. Result: The distribution of the sample mean X tends toward a normal distribution:\n            X∼N(μ, (σ^2)/n)\n\n# Why is the CLT Critical in Statistics?\n    # 1. Enables Statistical Inference:\n        # It allows us to use the normal distribution to estimate probabilities and create confidence intervals or hypothesis tests even when the population distribution is unknown.\n\n    # 2. Supports the Use of Parametric Methods:\n        # Many statistical tests (like the t-test, z-test, ANOVA) rely on the assumption of normality. The CLT justifies this assumption for sample means.\n\n    # 3. Predictability and Practicality:\n        # In real-world scenarios, we rarely know the true population distribution. The CLT assures us that we can still make accurate estimates using the sample mean.\n\n    # 4. Foundation for Many Models:\n        # It's the theoretical backbone of regression analysis, control charts, Bayesian methods, and more.\n\n# Example:\n    # Imagine measuring the heights of adult men. Even if the true population of heights is slightly skewed, if you take multiple random samples (e.g., of size 50) and plot the means of those samples, that distribution of sample means will form a bell-shaped curve.",
